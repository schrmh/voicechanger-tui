# Voice changer (Terminal User Interface)
A simple voice changer with a dialog frontend that uses sox

TODO:
- Add new dialog with a range box for a custom pitch
(+ an option to save changes as new sets)
- Add more default presets
- Add an option for noise profile creation (https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/425857)
- Add an option to create a new pulseaudio sink that other apps can use
- Add a switch so that users can choose to hear their own voice (or not)
